# ROM-R Methodology (Public Scaffolding)

**What this is:** Reproducible experimental architecture for stress testing learning systems and detecting emergent instability—without revealing proprietary equations or thresholds.

**What you’ll find**

- **Protocols:** how I structure hypotheses, controls, confounds, and stress tests.
- **Logging:** CSV schemas and example dashboards for post hoc analysis.
- **Benchmarks:** toy runs on MNIST, CIFAR, and Tiny ImageNet with transparent configs.
- **Limits & Ethics:** where this methodology applies—and where it doesn’t.

**What’s intentionally omitted**

- Novel mathematics, restoration gains, and collapse thresholds specific to my ROM‑R research.
- Tuned configurations, proprietary datasets, and internal notebooks. For collaborations or deeper details, please contact me.

## Method overview

1. **Define containment & admissible bounds** for the system under test.
2. **Specify detectors** (window sum and run‑rule) as placeholders; calibrate privately.
3. **Design stress profiles**—noise bursts, learning‑rate sweeps, and distribution shifts.
4. **Run & log** standardized metrics with reproducible seeds.
5. **Analyze** limitations, confounds, and cross‑experiment commonalities.
