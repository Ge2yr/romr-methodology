# Experiment Protocol Template

This template outlines the steps for designing, running, and analyzing an experiment.

1. **Hypothesis Formulation**: Define the hypothesis and research questions.
2. **Define Bounds**: Specify containment and admissible bounds for the system under test.
3. **Detector Selection**: Select detectors (e.g., window-sum, run-rule) and describe how thresholds will be calibrated privately.
4. **Stress Profiles**: Describe stress tests (noise bursts, learning-rate sweeps, distribution shifts).
5. **Experimental Runs**: Execute the experiment with reproducible seeds and log metrics.
6. **Analysis & Reporting**: Assess limitations, confounds, and emergent patterns across experiments.
