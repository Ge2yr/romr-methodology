# Potential Applications

These high-level insights and techniques can be applied to:

- **Early Warning Systems**: Detect instability in iterative processes across domains (e.g., finance, healthcare).
- **Model Monitoring**: Integrate residual-collapse detection into MLOps pipelines to flag anomalous training behavior.
- **Algorithm Evaluation**: Use stress tests to compare robustness across algorithms without exposing proprietary code.
- **Educational Tools**: Provide students with reproducible experiments highlighting limitations and confounds.
