# Boundaries & Non‑Disclosure

This repository contains only high‑level methodology and reproducible scaffolding. It deliberately omits proprietary details such as:

- All equations, derivations, and proprietary thresholds from the ROM‑R Calculus.
- Internal datasets, benchmarks, and tuned configurations.
- Full recursive modeling code and experimental parameters.

If you're interested in collaborating or learning more, please contact me via email or LinkedIn.
